# CarHaven

CarHaven is a user-friendly car buying and selling platform designed specifically for college students. It simplifies the used car search by filtering listings based on student budgets and offers a unique **price score model** to help users assess deal quality. Additionally, it features an FAQ guide tailored to the car buying process in Cuyahoga County, making the experience accessible even for first-time buyers.

## Architecture

CarHaven follows a typical three-tier architecture with separate frontend, backend, and database layers:

- **Frontend:** Built using React and TypeScript.
- **Backend:** Developed in Java Spring Boot, serving REST APIs.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL accessed via DrizzleORM.

2. **Frontend (client):**
   ```bash
   cd AutoHaven
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Backend (Java Spring Boot):**

## Usage / Examples

CarHaven is designed for non-technical users. Once registered, users can:

- **Search cars** using filters (Price, Make, Model, Mileage, etc.)
- **Like** listings to save them to their profile
- **Sell** a car by filling out a form
- **View car details** and contact the seller directly
- **Read a financing & buying guide** specific to Cuyahoga County

> Example: A student logs in, filters by "Toyota under $10,000", likes a few listings, views detailed info, and messages the seller.

## Development Retrospective

- **What went well:**
  - Clear weekly progress due to scheduled demos.
  - Simple, focused feature set helped reduce scope creep.

- **Mistakes & Improvements:**
  - Early challenges integrating frontend, backend, and DB couldâ€™ve been resolved faster with shared mock APIs or better interface planning.
  - Heavy documentation slowed development at times; maintaining developer journals may have helped balance both.
